# Implementation-of-different-CNN-models-
This project focuses on classifying maize leaf diseases using different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. I implemented and compared several models to evaluate their performance on the same dataset.
### ðŸ“Š Model Comparison

The table below compares all the implemented CNN models based on:
- Training Accuracy
- Test Accuracy
- Number of Parameters
- Model Size (in MB)

This helps identify models that balance **accuracy**, **complexity**, and **efficiency** for real-world deployment.
